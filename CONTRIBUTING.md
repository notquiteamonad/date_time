## Issues and Feedback Process

-   If you spot any issues with the project or wish to request any new features, feel free to add an issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
-   You can also use the issue tracker to leave feedback which I'll respond to if required.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Pick up any of our issues in the issue tracker (feel free to self-assign these).
2.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the issue. I'll respond as quickly as possible and am happy to help newcomers out if you don't know how to get started.
3.  Once you've edited the repo, put in a PR. Assign [@samueldple](https://github.com/samueldple/) and attach any labels you think fit the PR. Our bots will add more labels once you submit the PR.
4.  I'll get back to you with any changes that need making before the PR can be merged, and merge it once it all looks good
